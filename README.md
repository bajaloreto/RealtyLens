# RealtyLens

This is my capstone submission for Zach Wilson's DataExpert Data Engineering bootcamp.

RealtyLens is an application that provide analytic lens for daily rent and sale listings.

Check out the app here https://realtylens.streamlit.app/

As of now, the app is only available for the city of Philadelphia.
The map renders all the active properties in Philadelphia but will take a while to load all properties without filters (30 seconds) because of streamlit cloud's limitation (free tier) on shared memory

Please reach out to me if you have any questions or feedback.
